### Homework 4 Description

Write an astrology program. The user types in a birthday, and the program responds with the sign and horoscope for that birthday. The month may be entered as a number from 1 to 12. 

Your program should include a loop that lets the user repeat this calculation until the user says he or she is done.

The horoscope signs and dates are:

- **Aries**: March 21–April 19
- **Taurus**: April 20–May 20
- **Gemini**: May 21–June 21
- **Cancer**: June 22–July 22
- **Leo**: July 23–August 22
- **Virgo**: August 23–September 22
- **Libra**: September 23–October 22
- **Scorpio**: October 23–November 21
- **Sagittarius**: November 22–December 21
- **Capricorn**: December 22–January 19
- **Aquarius**: January 20–February 18
- **Pisces**: February 19–March 20

> **Note**: Use a "switch" statement to complete the implementation.
