### Homework 8 Description

This program numbers the lines found in a text file. Write a program that reads text from a file and outputs each line to the screen and to another file preceded by a line number. 

- Print the line number at the start of the line and right-adjusted in a field of three spaces.
- Follow the line number with a colon, then one space, then the text of the line.
- You should get a character at a time and write code to ignore leading blanks on each line.

You may assume that the lines are short enough to fit within a line on the screen. Otherwise, allow default printer or screen output behavior if the line is too long (that is, wrap or truncate).
