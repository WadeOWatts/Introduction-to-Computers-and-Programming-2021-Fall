### Homework 11 Description

Write a program that reads in a line of text and replaces all four-letter words with the word `"love"`. For example, the input string:

*I hate you, you dodo!*

should produce the output:

*I love you, you love!*

Of course, the output will not always make sense. For example, the input string:

*John will run home.*

should produce the output:

*Love love run love.*

If the four-letter word starts with a capital letter, it should be replaced by `"Love"`, not by `"love"`. You need not check capitalization, except for the first letter of a word. A word is any string consisting of the letters of the alphabet and delimited at each end by a blank, the end of the line, or any other character that is not a letter.

Your program should repeat this action until the user says to quit.
