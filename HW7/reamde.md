### Homework 7 Description

Write a function that calculates a discount applicable on the price of an item. Your function should have three arguments: the price as a reference to a *double*, the discount as a *double* value, and a *bool* to indicate if the discount is calculated as a percentage or a fixed amount. You should calculate the discount and modify the price of the item accordingly.

Modify your program so that it checks that the discount is not negative, and that the price of the item does not drop to zero after applying the discount. If it does violate these conditions, then your program should use an `assert` to exit the program.
