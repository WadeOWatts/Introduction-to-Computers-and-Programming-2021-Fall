Write a program to calculate the slope between two points \( x_1, y_1 \) and \( x_2, y_2 \). The points should be entered as four *double* values in the order x1, y1, x2, and y2.

The formula to calculate the slope, \( m \), between two points is:

$$
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

Output the calculated slope value.

Use this value to output the equation of the line in the form:

$$
y = mx + c
$$

You can calculate the value of \( c \) from one of the pair of points entered as input.
